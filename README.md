# Hotel-_-Management-_-System
This is a desktop-based application. It starts with a login window for authentication. After successful login, the main dashboard appears, providing access to different management panels.
# Objectives of the Project :
The main objectives of this project are:
o understand object-oriented programming concepts using Java
o implement a GUI-based application using Java Swing
o manage hotel-related data such as rooms, employees, and bookings
# Main Features:
User Login System
Room Management
Employee Management
Booking Management
GUI-based interactiono apply advanced programming concepts like event handling, classes, constructors, and collections
# Tools and Technologies Used:
Programming Language: Java
GUI Framework: Java Swing (JFrame, JPanel, JButton, JTextArea, etc.)
IDE: Any Java-supported IDE (IntelliJ IDEA / NetBeans)
JDK Version: JDK 8 or above
# Programming Concepts Used:
1.Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Classes and Objects
oConstructors
oEncapsulation
2.Java Collections (ArrayList)
3.Event Handling using ActionListener
4.Swing Components and Layout Managers
5.Multithreading using SwingUtilities
# Module Description:
1. Login Module:
This module authenticates the user before allowing access to the system. It ensures basic security by validating username and password.
2. Room Management Module:
Add new rooms
View available and booked rooms
Remove rooms
3. Employee Management Module:
Add employee details
View employee list
Remove employees
4. Booking Management Module:
Book rooms for customers
View booking details
Manage booking records
5. Manage Hotel :  _
Daily Reports
6. Room Service :
Order Food
# Output Description:
Login window appears at startup
After login, the main dashboard is displayed
User can navigate between Room, Employee, and Booking panels
Data is displayed dynamically using text areas and dialog boxes
# Conclusion:
The Hotel Management System project successfully demonstrates the use of advanced Java programming concepts and GUI development using Swing. This project helped in understanding real-world application development and enhanced practical knowledge of Java.
